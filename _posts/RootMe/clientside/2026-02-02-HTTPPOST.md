# RootMe – HTTP - POST Headers

**Mission**  
Find a way to beat the top score!

**Analysis**  
- The goal is to achieve a higher score than the current top (99999).  
- Playing normally will never let you win — the score is likely validated or sent from the client side.

**Solution steps**

1. Intercept the POST request using Burp Suite (or any proxy) when submitting your score/game result.  
2. Locate the parameter that holds your score value (likely something like `score=...` or similar in the POST body or headers).  
3. Modify the score value to a number higher than 99999 (e.g., `100000` or `999999`).  
4. Forward the modified request → you win the game with the new high score!

**Key takeaway**  
Client-side games or score submissions often trust the browser to send the correct value. Intercepting and tampering with POST parameters (or headers) is a classic way to bypass "impossible" restrictions in web challenges.

Finished. Happy Hacking!
