# PortSwigger – File Path Traversal Labs

## LAB 1: File Path Traversal, Simple Case

**Solution steps**

1. Open the challenge in Burp's embedded browser and check the HTTP history in the Proxy tab.

2. Identify requests fetching files from the server, such as image `25.jpg`.

3. Send the request to Repeater.

4. Change the filename to `/etc/passwd` (may fail), then try `../../../etc/passwd` → the response contains the `/etc/passwd` file contents.

## LAB 2: File Path Traversal, Traversal Sequences Blocked with Absolute Path Bypass

**Solution steps**

1. Open the challenge in Burp's embedded browser and check the HTTP history in the Proxy tab.

2. Identify requests fetching files from the server, such as image `34.jpg`.

3. Send the request to Repeater.

4. Change the filename to `/etc/passwd` → the response contains the `/etc/passwd` file contents.

## LAB 3: File Path Traversal, Traversal Sequences Stripped Non-Recursively

**Solution steps**

1. Open the challenge in Burp's embedded browser and check the HTTP history in the Proxy tab.

   ![](/assets/image/Portswigger/pathraversal/image5.png)

2. Identify requests fetching files from the server, such as image `53.jpg`.

3. Send the request to Repeater.

   > Note: The server filters `../`, so use nested sequences like `....//` to bypass the filter non-recursively.

4. Change the filename to `....//....//....//etc/passwd` → the filter removes one layer of `../`, leaving enough to traverse, and the response contains the `/etc/passwd` file.

## LAB 4: File Path Traversal, Traversal Sequences Stripped with Superfluous URL-Decode

**Solution steps**

1. Open the challenge in Burp's embedded browser and check the HTTP history in the Proxy tab.

   ![](/assets/image/Portswigger/pathraversal/image.png)

2. Identify requests fetching files from the server, such as image `25.jpg`.

3. Send the request to Repeater.

   > Note: The filter decodes the input multiple times, so encode the payload repeatedly to bypass.

4. Using `/etc/passwd` or `../../../etc/passwd` fails → URL-encode the payload multiple times (use Burp's "URL-encode all characters").

5. Send the request → the response contains the `/etc/passwd` file.

## LAB 5: File Path Traversal, Validation of Start of Path

**Solution steps**

1. Open the challenge in Burp's embedded browser and check the HTTP history in the Proxy tab.

   ![](/assets/image/Portswigger/pathraversal/image.png)

2. Identify requests fetching files from the server, such as `/var/www/images/28.jpg`.

3. Send the request to Repeater.

   > Note: The filter validates the start of the path (e.g., must begin with `/var/www/images/`).

4. Change `28.jpg` to `../../../etc/passwd` → first `../` backs to `/var/www/`, second to `/var/`, third to `/` (root) → the response contains the `/etc/passwd` file.

## LAB 6: File Path Traversal, Validation of File Extension with Null Byte Bypass

**Solution steps**

1. Open the challenge in Burp's embedded browser and check the HTTP history in the Proxy tab.

   ![](/assets/image/Portswigger/pathraversal/image.png)

2. Identify requests fetching files from the server, such as image `28.jpg`.

3. Send the request to Repeater.

   > Note: The request includes an `Accept` header limiting to image extensions. Bypass with a null byte (`%00`) to truncate the filename after `/etc/passwd`, while appending `.png` to pass the filter.

4. Change the filename to `../../../etc/passwd%00.png` → the response contains the `/etc/passwd` file.
