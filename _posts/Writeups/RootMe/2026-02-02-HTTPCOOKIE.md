# RootMe – HTTP - Cookies

**Mission**  
Get all emails from Bob.

**Analysis**  
- There's a basic script that collects emails from users.  
- Trying to access all emails fails because we are not an admin (access restricted by role).

**Solution steps**

1. Open Developer Tools → go to the **Application** tab → **Cookies** section.  
2. Look for the cookie that likely controls user role (value is set to `visitor`).

3. Edit the cookie value and change it from `visitor` to `admin`.  
4. Refresh/reload the page → the restricted content (all emails / password) now appears.

Finished. Happy Hacking! 🔓
