**Hi, I'm Mustafa Eltayeb (aka T4T4R1S).**

I am a passionate Cyber Security Engineer and an avid Capture The Flag (CTF) player. My journey in cybersecurity is driven by a deep curiosity for understanding how systems work and, more importantly, how they can be broken and secured.

This blog serves as my public notebook—a space where I document my learning path, solve intriguing challenges from platforms like **TryHackMe**, **HackTheBox**, and **Root-Me**,**Pwn-College** and share practical knowledge with the community. Here, you'll find detailed walkthroughs, technical write-ups, and insights from hands-on penetration testing and vulnerability research.

Beyond the flags and shells, I believe in the power of shared knowledge to strengthen our digital defenses.

**Let's connect, hack (ethically), and learn together.**
